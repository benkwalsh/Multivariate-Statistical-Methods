# Multivariate Statistical Methods

This was a course that I completed at the University of Canterbury during the first semester of 2023. I have included two of my favourite assignmments from the course. Each Assignment was worth 10% of the overall grade. I believe the two assignments I have provided give a good insight on the course and its values/skills it provided.

The Computational statistics file is a file involving multivariate estimation using non-parametric regression.

Sadly I lost alot of my files and cannot include my R code for the pdf's. Each assignment I coded in Rstudio to an R markdown file which I then handed in as a pdf. Despite this, alot of the code is visible in the assignments anyway :).
