# Multivariate-Statistical-Methods

This was a course that I completed at the University of Canterbury during the first semester of 2023. I have included two of my favourite assignmments from the course. Each Assignment was worth 10% of the overall grade. I believe the two assignments I have provided give a good insight on the course and its values/skills it provided me.
